                            I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world.
                            I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry.
                            Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative,
                            I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state,
                            and nation better places in which to live.
                            I will accept the responsibilities that are mine.
                            I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence.
                            I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living.
                            I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals.
                            Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability.
                            I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me,
                            and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.
